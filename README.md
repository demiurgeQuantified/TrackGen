# TrackGen
Generates track script files for Music for the End of the World's music radio system
## Usage
For Windows users, a binary is provided on the [Releases](/releases) page. If you're not on Windows or don't trust it, you can clone the repo and run TrackGen.py - ``PyOgg`` is required.

Pass Ogg Vorbis sound file(s) or folder(s) containing Ogg Vorbis sound file(s) as command line arguments or drag them onto the exe. Generated track scripts will be written to ``TrackGen_tracks.txt``. Folders will not be searched recursively. Sound names are guessed based on True Music naming conventions and may need adjustment.
## Configuration
No configuration is currently supported.
